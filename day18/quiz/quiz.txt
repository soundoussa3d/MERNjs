1-Can middleware functions have asynchronous operations, such as database queries or API calls?
 
 
Yes, middleware functions can contain asynchronous operations*********

 
 
No, middleware functions must be synchronous

 
 
Yes, but only for error handling

 
 
No, asynchronous operations are not supported in middleware


////////////////////////////////
What would happen without the next function in Express middleware?
 
 
The request-response cycle would continue indefinitely

 
 
The server will shutdown

 
 
The request-response cycle would be stuck at the current middleware************

 
 
Syntax error

/////////////////////////////
Can you use middleware for handling route-specific tasks in Express.js?
 
 
No, middleware is only for common tasks.

 
 
Yes, but it's not recommended.

 
 
Yes, middleware can handle route-specific tasks.*******

 
 
No, routes must handle their tasks.
/////////////////////////////////
Can you use multiple middleware functions in a single route in Express.js?
 
 
No, it's not possible

 
 
Yes, but only for error handling

 
 
Yes, you can stack multiple middleware functions******************

 
 
Yes, but only for get methods
///////////////////////////
Can you have conditional logic within a middleware function to determine whether to proceed to the next middleware or end the request-response cycle?
 
 
Yes, but it's not recommended

 
 
No, conditional logic is not allowed in middleware

 
 
Yes, you can use if statements or other conditional constructs

 
 
Yes, but it's a bad practice

////////////////////////////
When might you use middleware for authentication in an Express.js application?
 
 
Only for a specific route

 
 
Only for error handling
