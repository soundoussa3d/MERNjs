How can you use `await` in an asynchronous function to handle Promise resolution?
Which of the following options accurately describes the relationship between the async keyword and Promises?
What does the .then() method of a Promise return?
Which of the following is a common use case for using Promises?

Which feature of promises helps avoid callback hell in Node.js?
===>The feature of promises that helps avoid callback hell in Node.js is chaining. Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in a readable and manageable way, without nesting callbacks. This makes the code more readable and easier to maintain compared to deeply nested callbacks, which can lead to callback hell.


What happens if an error occurs in an async function that uses await?
==>The error is caught and can be handled using try-catch.

Which of the following best describes asynchronous programming in Node.js?
==>Executing tasks concurrently and handling results with callbacks

What is the difference between Promise.resolve(value) and new Promise(resolve => resolve(value))?
==>In summary, the key difference is in the timing of when the Promise is resolved, with Promise.resolve being immediate and new Promise(resolve => resolve(...)) being scheduled to resolve in the next tick of the event loop.

What are the possible states of a promise?
==>
Pending, resolved, rejected


 
Which of the following statements is true about async/await in Node.js?

How does async/await simplify error handling compared to using raw Promises?
=> It provides a simpler .catch() method to handle errors


Which of the following statements is true about using async/await in Node.js?
=>
`async/await` can only be used with Promises.


Why is asynchronous programming important in Node.js?
=>
It improves resource utilization and application performance


Which methods are associated with handling Promise rejections?
