MERN: MongoDB , ExpressJS , ReactJS ,  NodeJS
LAMP : Linux , Apache , Mysql ,  PHP
MEAN: MongoDB , ExpressJS ,AngularJS NodeJS 

*Express : A powerful middleware that sits on top of the server-side Node.js web APIs.

*MERN Full-Stack is a Javascript Stack utilized for more straightforward and quicker organization of full-stack web applications.

*Impacts of MERN Stack on the web app:
1-Cost-effective : the four technologies are open source
2-SEO friendly:(Search Engine Optimization)
3-Better performance due to the fast response between the Back-end , Front-End and Database(providing a smooth user interface)
4-Improves Security
5-Provide the fastest delivery (delivered faster to our client)
6-Provides faster Modifications :These technologies support quick modifications to clients' requests and are agile.
7-Open source
8-Easy to switch between client and server

*Mern Stack Components:
1-Front-End for the "web"
 => handled by "ReactJS"
2- The middle is the "Server"
 =>ExpressJS(maintains the server-side frameword and middleware running inside the nodejs server) and Node.js(a cross-platform runtime environment for executing Javascript code outside a browser)
3- Back-End as "Database"
 => MongoDB


 *MongoDB:
 1-Mongo DB is a popular NoSQL and open-source document-oriented database. 
 2-'NoSQL' is a non-relational database and does not require a fixed schema, therefore it stores the data in a different format, unlike the relational tables.
 3-The format in which the data is stored is known as BSON (Binary JavaScript Object Notation) 
 4-Its structure encodes the length and type of information and therefore allows it to be parsed much more quickly, also allowing a highly scalable and flexible document structure.
 5-It is faster than RDBMS as it has efficient storage and better indexing techniques. 
 6-MongoDB uses JavaScript as a coding language which in itself is a big advantage for this stack. 
 7-As it is Schemaless, data stored is stored in a separate document. 
 8-It supports a flexible document model, which is remarkably fast for any developer to create. 
 9-MongoDB can easily scale by adding more and more servers, and at the same time, it increases productivity with its flexible document model
