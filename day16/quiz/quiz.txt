///////////////////////////////////////
What is the main advantage of setting up the foundation for a web application using Express?
 
 
Slows down development

 
 
Requires extensive configuration

 
 
Limits scalability

 
 
Simplifies server-side logic**
//////////////////////////////////
Why is the extensive ecosystem and active community important for Express?
 
 
It makes Express slower

 
 
It is not important

 
 
They contribute to its widespread adoption**

 
 
It hinders development
///////////////////////////////
Express.js applications can only handle HTTP requests.

False. Express.js applications can handle both HTTP and HTTPS requests. While it is commonly used for handling HTTP requests, Express.js can also be configured to handle HTTPS requests by creating an HTTPS server using the https module in Node.js.
//////////////////////////////////////
What is Express.js?

It lacks features

 
 
It is only for mobile development

/////////////////////////////////
What does Express simplify in the process of web development?
 
 
Database management

Client-side logic

 
 
Both client-side and server-side logic
///////////////////////////////

What is the modular structure of Express beneficial for?
 
 
Easy integration of additional features and middleware*********

 
 
Slowing down web application development

 
 
Preventing the integration of additional features

 
 
Creating monolithic applications
//////////////////////////////////////////
Express.js provides built-in security mechanisms to prevent common web vulnerabilities.

False. Express.js itself does not provide built-in security mechanisms to prevent common web vulnerabilities. It is up to the developers to implement proper security measures such as input validation, authentication, authorization, and protection against common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF). Express.js provides a flexible framework that allows developers to implement these security measures as needed.
